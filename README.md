<h2> 👨‍🏫  About Me </h2>

<p align="justify">
I am a passionate computer science teacher. I have been teaching programming languages, web development, and computer science-related subjects to millions of Bangla-speaking students worldwide through my YouTube channel for the last eight years. I had the opportunity to teach thousands of Bachelors's and Higher secondary students at different institutions in Bangladesh. After completing my master's in Software, Web and Cloud in August 2021, I am improving my web development skills. Every day I want to learn something new and share my knowledge with my students and others.
